# Programming_Assignement2

Goal: write a program in either C, C++, Java, Python, or Perl to implement, on our server
sp-cfsics.metrostate.edu, a simplified AES like encryption/decryption algorithm designed by
you, which includes at least the following three strategies:

1) XOR
2) Bit circulate shift
3) Substitution box

§ Assumption: 16-bit plaintext/ciphertext block with a 16-bit key.

§ Requirements:

§ Your program should prompt for the plaintext/ciphertext input either from the command
line, a window, or a data file;

§ Your program should prompt for the choice of keys;

§ Your program should display the corresponding ciphertext/plaintext after a plaintext/ciphertext block and a key are determined;

§ Your program should provide the ability to allow the user to loop back to repeat your algorithm;

§ Your program should be documented properly based on the requirements you learned from your programming courses.

§ Turn in:

§ The source code files and data files (if any);

§ The screenshots of four sample runs of your program with two for encryptions and two for decryptions;

§ A README file for explaining how to use/configure/install your program;

§ A brief report (at least one page in length) on your algorithm in terms of how those three operations, XOR, bit circulate shift, and substitution box, are implemented, as well as your justification and assessment on your algorithm and implementation.
